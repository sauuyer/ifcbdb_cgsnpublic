and her's a list of the files that ended up needing editing:
        modified:  Dockerfile
	modified:  docker-compose.yml
	modified:  nginx-ssl.conf.template
	modified:  nginx.conf.template
	newly created files: ssl/ * files
other commands that were helpful:
generating the ssl docs:
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -aes256
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key key.pem -sha256 -days 365
after configuring the docker files, but before running docker compose...
docker build -t ifcbdb .
docker run -p 8443:8443 ifcbdb
