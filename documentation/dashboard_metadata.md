# Dashboard Metadata

### Proposed Dashboard Organization
- Each dataset within the dashboard represents an OOI array
- The only currently existing dataset is associated with the CGSN Pioneer Array
- Each dataset can contain discrete, underway and moored IFCB data outputs


### Metadata Definitions 
- Latitude and longitude: (different for each type)
- Cruise field: (use as Deployment field)
- Instrument: (instrument #)
- Sample type: ("underway", "discrete", "moored")
  

### Proposed Tags
- Targeted sample depths: "surface", "chlorophyll max", "moored ifcb depth"
- Nearby site: [within 2 km of a given site center}
- (injected_air, wow, cruise numbers, QA tags, test)


### Data Organization
- do we need any details about how the raw data repository is organized in relation to the dashboard?
